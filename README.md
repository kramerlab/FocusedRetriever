> **Note:** This README and the code documentation will soon be updated and expanded.  
> In the meantime, the following instructions should help you get started:

## Getting started
1. Download embeddings and SKB's from [https://github.com/snap-stanford/stark](https://github.com/snap-stanford/stark).
2. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`.
3. Adjust the configuration settings in `configs.json`.
4. Run `main.py` with the arguments defined in the `parse_args()` function.
5. If needed, modify `llm_bridge` to suit your local LLM setup or api-based access. For api-based access, add a `.env` file with your api keys to the main directory.
